LangChain Document Loader Example

LangChain helps developers build applications powered by large language models (LLMs).
A document loader is the first step in most pipelines. It is responsible for loading data
from different sources, such as text files, PDFs, web pages, or databases.

This is a simple text file that you can use to test the TextLoader in LangChain.

Key points:
- Document loaders get the raw data.
- Text splitters divide documents into smaller chunks.
- Embeddings convert text into numerical vectors.
- Vector stores make searching and retrieval efficient.
