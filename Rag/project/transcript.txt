I fell into a huge crevasse...'...you know - a big hole -
about ten metres deep.'Were you hurt'Yes, I broke my arm.'I couldn`t climb out.'What did you do'Well, fortunately, my sledge
fell into the hole with me...'...so I had food, and I had my radio,
too.'And I called for help.'How long were you there
before they found you'Five days.'There was a bad storm, you see.'I thought it was the end, but then
suddenly I heard voices and dogs.'I shouted and shouted and faces
appeared above me.'What did you think about,
while you were in the crevasse'I thought about my life back in England.'And the funny thing was that all my
problems at home and at work...'...weren`t important any more.'I just wanted to be with my
family and friends again.'Life`s very short, you know.
You have to enjoy it while you can.'Thank you very much.'Can I just look at that last part again'I thought about my life back in England.'And the funny thing was that all my
problems at home and at work...'...weren`t important any more.'I just wanted to be with my family

a party to go to.'What do you think, Rebecca'The skirt or the trousers'I can`t afford both.'Hmm. I don`t know.

clothes...'...for his interview with that
magazine.'Oh yes. What did he say'The readers of Stars and
